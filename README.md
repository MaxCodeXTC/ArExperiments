# Augmented Reality Experiments
A set of experiments using augmented reality. WebXR + Threejs are the predominate tools used.

# Caveats

## Chrome
These will only work on chromium derived browsers. Even then only chrome is particularly reliable.

## Chrome Flags
Many of these experiments require chrome flags enabled specifically: Experimental Web Platform Features and Generic Sensor Extra Classes enabled. These introduce some security issues so try to only visit trusted sites while using these flags (although I believe they aren't commonly exploited yet).

## SSL certificates
Most of these html pages must be served over SSL. These files should work on local server; however, local network servers will have issues. Unless you're running the server off of the phone you'll have difficulties without an SSL certificate.

# Experiments

## Skeleton
Is a minimal boilerplate for building 3d webXR apps

## Regina
Uses google's GIS data to build a subsection of regina in AR

## Many Bodies
Shows an N-body simulation in ar.

## Magnetometer
Shows the magnetometers recordings in augmented reality
