## Setup

### Chrome
These will only work on chromium derived browsers. Even then only chrome is particularly reliable.

### Chrome Flags
Many of these experiments require chrome flags enabled specifically: Experimental Web Platform Features and Generic Sensor Extra Classes enabled. These introduce some security issues so try to only visit trusted sites while using these flags (although I believe they aren't commonly exploited yet).

### SSL certificates
Most of these html pages must be served over SSL. These files should work on local server; however, local network servers will have issues. Unless you're running the server off of the phone you'll have difficulties without an SSL certificate.
